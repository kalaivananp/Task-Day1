Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?

HTTP1:
HTTP1 loads a single request for every TCP connection
 This version included many performance enhancements like:
 keepalive connections, caching mechanisms, request pipelining, transfer encodings, and byte-range requests.
It is invented in 1997 and become the stardarised internet

HTTP2:
It can send multiple requests for data in parallel over a single TCP connection
HTTP2 is much faster and more efficient than HTTP/1.1
HTTP2 solves several problems that the creators.
 HTTP/1 did not anticipate in particular

 MULTIPLEXING:
 HTTP1 loads resources one after the other, so if one resource cannot be loaded
HTTP2 is able to use a single TCP connection to send multiple streams of data at once so that no one resource blocks any other resource.
Multiplexing addresses these problems by allowing multiple request and response messages to be in flight at the same time
