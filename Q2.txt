Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

Objects and its internal representation:

1.Objects are important data types in javascript. 
2.Objects are complex and each object may contain a combination of primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
3.An object is a reference data type. 
4.The reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.
5.An object can be created with figure brackets {} with an optional list of properties. 
6.. For example, let’s create an object named myBike and give it properties named make, model, and year as follows:
var myBike = new Object();
myBike.make = 'Dominer';
myBimke.model = 'Wrench';
myBike.year = 2020;
